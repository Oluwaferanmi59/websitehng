        <p class="goals">
            Over the next two years, I am dedicated to transforming myself into 
            a proficient full-stack developer. This journey will involve mastering 
            both front-end and back-end technologies, <br>allowing me to build comprehensive 
            and dynamic web applications from start to finish. My learning path will 
            encompass a deep dive into modern JavaScript frameworks <br>like React for 
            the front end and powerful back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express. 
            I also plan to gain expertise in database management systems like <br>MongoDB and 
            PostgreSQL, ensuring I can handle all aspects of web development.
            One of my ambitious goals is to secure a position at a leading tech company. 
            <br>I aim to contribute to groundbreaking projects and be part of a team that is 
            pushing the boundaries of technology. Working in such an environment will not 
            only challenge <br>me to apply my skills at the highest level but also provide 
            invaluable opportunities for learning and professional growth. My focus will 
            be on staying updated with <br>industry trends, continuously enhancing my skills, 
            and building a portfolio that showcases my capabilities.
            Equally important to my career aspirations is my desire to give <br>back to the 
            community. I believe in the power of technology to bring positive change, and 
            I am committed to leveraging my skills to make a meaningful impact. <br>Over the 
            next two years, I plan to engage in various community service projects, 
            particularly those that use technology to address societal issues. This could 
            involve <br>volunteering for local nonprofits, contributing to open-source projects, 
            or developing applications that solve real-world problems.
            One of my deepest passions is to inspire <br>and mentor young kids, especially those 
            from underrepresented communities. I want to show them that a career in tech is 
            not only achievable but also incredibly rewarding. <br>To this end, I will actively 
            participate in mentorship programs, conduct coding workshops, and collaborate with 
            schools and community centers. By sharing my knowledge <br>and experiences, I hope to 
            ignite a spark of curiosity and ambition in the next generation of tech enthusiasts.
